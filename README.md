# Key Points

## 1. Introduction to Algorithm Design 

1. An algorithm is a procedure that takes any of the possible input instances 
and transforms it to a desired output.

2. An algorithm has 3 properties, correctness, efficiency and ease of implementationj. 

3. There is a fundamental difference between algorithms which always produce a 
correct result, and heuristics which may usually do a good job bu without
providing any guarantee.

4. Seeking counterexamples that break pretender algorithms in an important part
of the algorithm design process.

5. Reasonable looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Algorithm correctness
is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.

6. Mathematical proofs consist of 4 parts:
    - Clear precise statement of what's to be proved
    - Set of assumptions of things which are taken to be true and used as part 
    of the proof
    - Chain of reasoning which leads from the assumptions to the statement to be
    proven
    - QED which denotes completed
    
7. The idea behind any algorithm must be clearly revealed when the algorithm is 
expressed, if this doesn't happen then the notation used is too low-level.

8. Problem specifications have 2 parts:
    - Set of allowed input instances
    - Required properties of the algorithm's output
